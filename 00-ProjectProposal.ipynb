    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",

No-kill shelters may have higher rates of disability or illness amongst the animals, while open-admission shelters have higher rates of euthanization. \n",

Some of these variables are related to conditions that some may find discriminatory, such as any potential disabilities that an animal might have. This would have a direct negative impact on the animals’ wellbeing and quality of life as a consequence of potential bias in our analysis. However, we believe that by showing the statistics of animals that are less often adopted, people would be more willing to adopt the less-adopted animals.\n",
