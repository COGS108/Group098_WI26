    "With millions of animals continuing to enter shelters, limited housing capacity, staffing, and funding in many communities have forced shelters to triage scarce resources， determining which animals can be made available for adoption and, in the worst cases, which animals cannot be maintained safely in care. **Overall, from 2013–2025, the U.S. sheltering landscape shows a mixed trajectory: measurable lifesaving gains in the mid-2010s followed by renewed system strain after 2020, making shelter “throughput” (e.g., length-of-stay, LOS) increasingly central to sustaining high live outcomes.**\n",

    "**From 2013 to 2020, national estimates suggest progress, though uneven and still capacity-limited.** The ASPCA reported euthanasia declining to about 1.5 million annually (down from about2.6 million in 2011) alongside an 18.5% increase in adoptions to roughly 3.2 million per year [1]. Best Friends’ 2020 national summary similarly framed remaining need as a lifesaving gap and reported improved national performance (e.g., an 83% save rate and growth in the share of “no-kill” shelters), while emphasizing that progress varied across communities [2].\n",

    "**After 2020, capacity stress became more visible in national reporting, strengthening the case for LOS-focused analysis.** Shelter Animals Count described a sustained “capacity crisis” since January 2021 and reported that 2023 dog euthanasia reached 359,000 (with 2023 also the first year in their database when more dogs than cats were euthanized) [3][4]. The ASPCA reports 4.2 million adoptions and about 607,000 euthanasias in 2024, noting adoptions were not enough to significantly reduce the number of animals in shelters nationwide [5]. **Prior work indicates LOS depends on both animal traits and shelter operations and can be context-specific:** Brown et al. (2013) found LOS varied with factors such as age and size in two no-kill shelters [6], while some appearance variables were not consistently predictive, and Capacity for Care evaluations suggest management practices can shift adoption-related timing and outcomes [7]. Austin is an especially strong case because the city has explicitly prioritized no-kill goals through public planning and partnerships [8][9], reports very high live release performance (e.g., 97.5% in a November 2015 City report) [10], and provides open Intakes and Outcomes data from Oct 1, 2013 to May 5, 2025 that enable direct LOS computation at scale [11][12].\n",

    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",

    "> Our data is collected from a no-kill shelter, which means that at least 90% of the shelter's inhabitants are not euthanized. This will create discrepancies between the data of no-kill shelters such as this one and open-admission shelters.

    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",

    "> Our results may affect what people look for in a pet and thus change the adoption outcomes of animals with certain traits or qualities. Some of these variables are related to conditions that some may find discriminatory, such as any potential disabilities that an animal might have. This would have a direct negative impact on the animals’ wellbeing and quality of life as a consequence of potential bias in our analysis. However, we believe that by showing the statistics of animals that are less often adopted, people would be more willing to adopt the less-adopted animals.\n",
