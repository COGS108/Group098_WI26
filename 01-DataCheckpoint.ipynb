    "With millions of animals continuing to enter shelters, limited housing capacity, staffing, and funding in many communities have forced shelters to triage scarce resources，determining which animals can be made available for adoption and, in the worst cases, which animals cannot be maintained safely in care. **Overall, from 2013–2025, the U.S. sheltering landscape shows a mixed trajectory: measurable lifesaving gains in the mid-2010s followed by renewed system strain after 2020, making shelter “throughput” (e.g., length-of-stay, LOS) increasingly central to sustaining high live outcomes.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**From 2013 to 2020, national estimates suggest progress, though uneven and still capacity-limited.** The ASPCA reported euthanasia declining to about 1.5 million annually (down from about2.6 million in 2011) alongside an 18.5% increase in adoptions to roughly 3.2 million per year [1]. Best Friends’ 2020 national summary similarly framed remaining need as a lifesaving gap and reported improved national performance (e.g., an 83% save rate and growth in the share of “no-kill” shelters), while emphasizing that progress varied across communities [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "**After 2020, capacity stress became more visible in national reporting, strengthening the case for LOS-focused analysis.** Shelter Animals Count described a sustained “capacity crisis” since January 2021 and reported that 2023 dog euthanasia reached 359,000 (with 2023 also the first year in their database when more dogs than cats were euthanized) [3][4]. The ASPCA reports 4.2 million adoptions and about 607,000 euthanasias in 2024, noting adoptions were not enough to significantly reduce the number of animals in shelters nationwide [5]. **Prior work indicates LOS depends on both animal traits and shelter operations and can be context-specific:** Brown et al. (2013) found LOS varied with factors such as age and size in two no-kill shelters [6], while some appearance variables were not consistently predictive, and Capacity for Care evaluations suggest management practices can shift adoption-related timing and outcomes [7]. Austin is an especially strong case because the city has explicitly prioritized no-kill goals through public planning and partnerships [8][9], reports very high live release performance (e.g., 97.5% in a November 2015 City report) [10], and provides open Intakes and Outcomes data from Oct 1, 2013 to May 5, 2025 that enable direct LOS computation at scale [11][12].\n",

Seasonal and high-capacity periods will further lengthen LOS, but trait and intake-condition effects will remain the primary drivers."

    "### Austin Animal Center Intakes (10/01/2013 to 05/05/2025) \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we used comes from the Austin Animal Center and contains records of animals that entered the shelter system in Austin, Texas between October 2013 and May 2021. It includes information about individual animals at the time they were brought into the shelter, such as intake date and time, intake type, animal type, breed, color, sex upon intake, age upon intake, and intake condition. Each row represents a single intake event for an animal, meaning the dataset is structured at the event level rather than the individual animal level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several important metrics are included in this dataset. The DateTime variable records the exact timestamp of intake in standard date-time format, which allows analysis of seasonal or temporal patterns in shelter intake volume. Age upon intake is typically reported in units such as years, months, weeks, or days, representing the estimated age of the animal at intake; this variable may require conversion into a consistent numerical unit (for example, years) for statistical analysis. Animal Type indicates species (e.g., dog, cat, or other animals), while Breed and Color provide descriptive categorical attributes that may influence intake trends or outcomes. Intake Type (e.g., stray, owner surrender, public assist) describes how the animal entered the shelter system and is an important variable for understanding shelter operations and community behavior. Intake Condition describes the health or physical status of the animal upon arrival and may relate to medical resource needs or survival outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several potential concerns with this dataset. First, the data only represent animals that were brought to the Austin Animal Center and therefore do not reflect all animals in the Austin area. Animals that were never captured, taken to private shelters, or kept by finders are not included, which introduces geographic and institutional sampling bias. Second, some variables rely on human estimation or reporting, such as breed identification and age estimation, which may introduce measurement error or inconsistency. Shelter staff may visually estimate breed, which is known to be imperfect, especially for mixed-breed animals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, missing data may occur in variables such as sex upon intake or age upon intake, particularly for stray animals where information is unknown. There may also be inconsistencies in categorical labels over time due to changes in data entry practices or shelter procedures. Finally, repeated intake events for the same animal could appear as multiple records if animals re-enter the shelter, which could affect analyses if not properly accounted for depending on the research question."

    "This dataset also comes from the Austin Animal shelter, containing the records of animals that left the shelter system in Austin, Texas during the same time period as the previous dataset. The information it includes about these animals are its date of birth, name, the date and time the animal left the shelter, the outcome type and subtype (e.g. where the animal went to after it left), sex upon outcome, age upon outcome, breed, and color. Like the previous dataset, this dataset is structured at the event level over the individual animal level. \n",
    "\n",
    "Out of the variables used for both datasets, the animal ID, animal type, breed, color, and birthdate (if listed) can be used to join or cross-reference the two datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of the important metrics in the dataset, the categories Outcome Type and Outcome Subtype are not included nor is a variant of another metric in the previous dataset and so needs an explanation. Outcome Type lists what happened to the animal as they left the shelter, with values such as transfer, adoption, return to owner, and euthanization. Outcome Subtype contains the location they ended up or the reason for their departure, providing additional context as to why the animal left. These are important metrics because as a no-kill shelter (having a non-euthanization rate of at least 90%), they provide information about where the animal goes if it is sick or the shelter gets overpopulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several potential concerns with this dataset concerns its ability to generalize to all animal shelter outcomes. As mentioned above, this data is from a no-kill shelter, so the shelter will do all it can to not euthanize animals. This will lead to drastically different outcomes than an open admissions shelter, which do euthanize animals when the shelter becomes overpopulated. Another concern is that since this dataset is taken from only one shelter in a specific city, it does not reflect all outcomes in the entire city— let alone the state or the country. In fact, Texas is one of the biggest exporters of shelter animals, shipping them to areas with high demand for pet animals such as New York. This means that the data from this shelter may be significantly different from any data collected in other animal shelters."

No-kill shelters may have higher rates of disability or illness amongst the animals, while open-admission shelters have higher rates of euthanization. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Our results may affect what people look for in a pet and thus change the adoption outcomes of animals with certain traits or qualities. Some of these variables are related to conditions that some may find discriminatory, such as any potential disabilities that an animal might have. This would have a direct negative impact on the animals’ wellbeing and quality of life as a consequence of potential bias in our analysis. However, we believe that by showing the statistics of animals that are less often adopted, people would be more willing to adopt the less-adopted animals.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n"
